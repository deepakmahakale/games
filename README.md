# Games

The purpose of this repository is to try building existing games (and new if I can develop some :stuck_out_tongue:).

## Shell Games

Play games on your shell.

1. Guess The Number

    ```
    $ ./shell/guess_the_number.sh

    Guess a number between 1 and 100
    50
    Too high
    17
    Too low
    19
    Too high
    18
    You got the correct number in 4 guesses.
    ```

    bash <(curl -s https://deepakmahakale.in/games/shell/guess_the_number.sh)
